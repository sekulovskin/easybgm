\title{Calculate Clustering Bayes Factors for when using the Stochastic Block Model
as an edge prior}
\usage{
clusterBayesfactor(fit, type = "complement", b1 = NULL, b2 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A fitted object of class \code{easybgm} or \code{bgms} containing
the clustering results.}

\item{type}{A character string specifying the type of Bayes factor to calculate.
Options are \code{"simple"} or \code{"complement"}. Defaults to \code{"simple"}.}

\item{b1}{Indicates the number of clusters according to the first simple hypothesis,
required for \code{type = "simple"}.}

\item{b2}{Indicates the number of clusters according to the first simple hypothesis,
required for \code{type = "simple"}.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the Bayes factor.
}
\description{
This function calculates Bayes factors to evaluate evidence in favor of
clustering for models fitted with the \code{bgms} packae with
\code{edge_prior = "Stochastic-Block"}. It supports two types of calculations:
simple Bayes factors between two hypothesized number of clusters (\code{b1} and \code{b2}),
and Bayes factor of the hypothesis of clustering against the null hypothesis of
no clustering.
